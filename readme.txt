In this code, the Contact class represents an individual contact, with attributes for first name, last name, and phone number. The ContactManager class manages a list of contacts and provides methods to add contacts and save them to a file.

The get_user_input function is used to gather the contact information from the user. The main function provides a menu-driven interface where users can choose to add contacts, save contacts to a file, or quit the program.

When the contacts are saved to a file, each contact's information is written as a comma-separated string on a separate line.

You can run this code, add multiple contacts, and save them to a file by providing the filename.
